## Simulation model for a Pacific salmon species

## we need to start from 
# log(Rt)=log(St)+ at â€“bSt + wt.
# R = recruitment
# S = spawners
# a = density-independent productivity
# b = strength of density dependence
# w = autocorrelated process error (environmental stochasticity)

# let's start with up to 5 age classes
